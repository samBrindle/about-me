        <h3>Brief Summary About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Sam Brindle. I am enrolled in a course at Code Fellows in Washington state but recently finished
            my Associates Degree at Shoreline CC. I have never had a job in tech before, with my most recent employer being a 
            natural dying company. I plan to learn the skills of a full stack software developer through Code Fellows and 
            aspire to finish my Undergraduate Degree in Computer Science with a focus in Cyber Security. While I am sure my path
            sounds rather unclear to you as a reader I appreciate you coming to my page and reading about me.
